    <p>The only sure-fire approach to ensure that your gaming PC is capable of meeting all of your needs is to build it from the ground up. You'll be able to play the games you want at the frame rates you desire if you know everything that goes into your computer, from the power supply to the motherboard. A home-built PC also allows you to update as technology advances, your gaming preferences and demands change, or your budget allows. Though building a PC can seem intimidating, you might find that it’s easier than you think, especially when broken into manageable steps. That's why we've put together this comprehensive step-by-step guide to building your first gaming PC, complete with tips and tricks from our veteran builders.</p>

        <ol>PREP 1: PC Build Tools</ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Workspace - A big work area, such as a table, will be required. Make sure you stand on an uncarpeted area to avoid an unintended electrostatic discharge (which might harm sensitive components).</li>
                <li>Screwdrivers - You will need a Phillips #2 screwdriver for just about everything. If you're installing an M.2 device, you'll also need a Phillips #0 screwdriver.</li>
            </ul>

        <ol>PREP 2: Gaming PC Cases</ol>
            <ul>
                <li>You should have a case or, at the very least, a case size in mind before you start selecting out components. When choosing a case, the most important factor to consider is where you'll put your computer. The eventual location of your PC will decide how big you can or can't go, as well as whether or not certain premium case features are worth it. If the computer will be hidden under your desk, you probably don't want to spend for a tempered glass side panel.</li>
                <li>Cases typically come in three sizes: Full-tower, mid-tower, and mini-tower.</li>               
            </ul>

        <ol>PREP 3: Gaming PC Parts</ol>
            <ul>   
                <li>Central processing unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
                <li>Graphics processing unit (GPU)</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
                <li>Power supply unit (PSU)</li>
                <li>System cooling</li>
                <li>Gaming peripherals</li>
                <li>Operating system (OS)</li>
            </ul>

        <ol><b>STEP 1: INSTALL CPU</b></ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the motherboard out of its antistatic packaging and put it on your work surface. Find the CPU socket, which will be covered with a protective plastic cap. In one corner of the plastic cap, or more commonly, on the socket itself, you'll see a small arrow take note of where this arrow is. Next to the CPU socket, you'll see a small metal lever. Press down on the lever and pull it gently to the side away from the socket to open the socket tray.
                   Open the CPU and remove it from its packaging. Be very careful when handling the CPU both the CPU and the CPU socket are extremely susceptible to physical damage. Hold the CPU on the edges never touch the pins on the bottom of the chip, because your fingers can add dust or oil, and try not to touch the top of the chip either. In one corner of the CPU, you'll see an arrow. Line this arrow up with the arrow on the socket, and gently place the CPU onto the socket. Once the CPU has been gently seated, you can lower the retention lever down and push it back into place. Lowering the lever may require some force, but seating the CPU will not!</li>
            </ul>

        <ol><b>STEP 2: (OPTIONAL) INSTALL M.2 SSDs</ol></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Now is a wonderful time to get an M.2 SSD installed on your computer. To begin, locate your motherboard's M.2 slot. Across from it is a little horizontal slot with a tiny screw. Consult the user manual that came with your motherboard if you can't find it, if you find several M.2 slots, or if you plan to install more than one M.2 SSD.</li>
                <li>Remove the tiny screw with a Phillips #0 screwdriver. Don't lose it.</li>
                <li>Gently insert the M.2 SSD into the slot. It will be around a 35-degree angle from the motherboard when properly seated. Replace the little screw that holds the SSD in place by pushing it down.</li>
            </ul>
    
     <hr>
    
         <ol><b>STEP 3: INSTALL MEMORY (RAM)</b></ol>
            <ul>
                Determine how many RAM slots your motherboard has (most have either two or four). If you're going to fill all available RAM slots, simply snap the RAM into place. If you're not going to fill all of the RAM slots, consult the user manual to find the correct configuration and populate the RAM slots accordingly.
            </ul>

         <ol><b>STEP 4: MOUNT POWER SUPPLY</ol></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Unpack the PSU or unplug it from the components if you opted for a test run and set its cables aside if you can.
                    Take a look at your case and figure out where the PSU is supposed to go probably on the bottom, near the back and how it can be oriented. Ideally, you want to orient the PSU so that its fan faces outside the case (via a vent). If your case has a vent on the bottom, you can mount the PSU upside down, so long as the bottom vent will receive decent airflow when the PC is finished.
                    If your case has no vents, mount the PSU so the fan is facing up into the case and make sure it has enough clearance.</li>
                <li>Attach the PSU to the case using the four screws that came with the PSU.
                    If you're using a non-modular or semi-modular power supply, now is the time to run the attached cables through the case to where they'll need to end up (make use of cable management features if your case has them).</li>
            </ul>
     
     <hr>
    
         <ol><b>STEP 5: INSTALL MOTHERBOARD</b></ol>
         <ul>
            <li>If your motherboard came with an unattached I/O shield a rectangular sheet of metal with cutouts for the motherboard's ports you should first snap it into place in the back of your case make sure it's oriented correctly. I/O shields usually have sharp edges, so watch your fingers.
                Once the I/O shield is in place, you can install the motherboard. Double-check to make sure your cables are all threaded through to the correct place, and then place the motherboard align it with the I/O shield, first. Using a Phillips #2 screwdriver, mount the first screw the center screw to hold the motherboard in place. Make sure you do not drag your motherboard across the standoffs attached to the chassis.</li>
            <li>The number of screws you will need to mount the motherboard will vary based on the board, but a full-size ATX motherboard usually takes 9 screws. Fill all available screw holes.</li>
            <li>Connect the power supply to the motherboard. There are two main connections an 8-pin CPU connector toward the top of the board and a 24-pin connector from the side.</li>

            </ul>

         <ol><b>STEP 6: INSTALL GPU</b></ol>
         <ul>
             <li>Find the PCIe* x16 slot on your motherboard. It will be the longest PCIe* slot and may be a different color than the others. If your motherboard has more than one PCIe* x16 slot, check the user manual to see if one slot needs to be prioritized. If any slot can be used, determine which slot you'll be using based on where other components are placed you want your GPU to have some breathing room.</li>
             <li>Depending on your case, you may need to remove I/O covers small metal tabs blocking the back panel of your case to accommodate your GPU's I/O (HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, etc.) and make it accessible to the exterior of the chassis.</li>
             <li>Remove the GPU from its antistatic packaging and carefully align it with both the rear retention bracket and the slot itself, and then gently push it into the PCIe* x16 slot you may hear a click. The PCIe* tab on the motherboard may move into a locked position should you need to reseat the GPU.</li>
             <li>Once the GPU is fully seated, secure it to the back of the case using one or two screws. If your GPU requires auxiliary power connectors, connect it to the power supply.</li>
         </ul>
     <hr>

         <ol><b>STEP 9: INSTALL STORAGE</b></ol>
         <ul>
             <li>You should be able to find a stack of bays in different sizes somewhere inside your case. They may have little plastic switches, in which case they are tool-free bays, or they may just look like metal brackets.</li>
             <li>Slide the tray back into the bay. It should click into place.</li>
             <li>If you don't have tool-free bays, you'll see a metal bracket it will be big, like a sheet, with slats or holes in it. To put a drive in one of these "bays," all you have to do is slide the drive between the metal bracket and the side of your case and screw it into place. Use as many screws as the chassis manual recommends, but if you don't have enough screws most drives will be fine with just two screws.</li>
             <li>Once your drives are all in place, connect them to the motherboard using a SATA cable, which should have come with either your drive or your motherboard and to the power supply.</li>
         </ul>
     <hr>
         
         <ol><b>STEP 10: INSTALL OPERATING SYSTEM</b></ol>
         <ul>
             <li>Plug in the USB flash drive that contains your OS, as well as a monitor, mouse, and keyboard, and turn on your PC.</li>
             <li>The first screen you see will tell you to press a key to enter the system setup or BIOS. Press the key to open BIOS.</li>
             <li>First, you'll want to check to makes sure your components are all installed and being recognized. Find the page in BIOS that shows your PC's system info and check to make sure the system is recognizing everything you've installed so far.</li>
             <li>Next, poke around BIOS until you find the Boot page. Change the boot order so that your flash drive is first and the drive you want to install your OS on is second.</li>
             <li>Restart your computer. Your computer will boot from the USB and the OS installer will pop up. Follow the instructions to finish the installation.</li>
         </ul>
