    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Valorant is a near-future team-based first-person hero shooter. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. 
        Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.
        Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed.
        The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. 
        Different agents allow players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists, and hunters of every description. It currently offers 18 agents to choose from.They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, and Neon.

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>Riot Games, the studio behind League of Legends, created and published Valorant. Within their research and development section, development began in 2014. Valorant was created with two main goals in mind: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players,
         and building a game that would attract a significant competitive scene while addressing many of the criticisms leveled at other games in the genre by professional players. Riot picked Unreal Engine 4 to build Valorant, claiming that doing so will allow them to concentrate on gameplay and optimizations rather than fundamental systems. 
         Riot Games promised throughout development that at least 70% of the game's players will have a ping of less than 35 milliseconds. 
        Riot promised 128-tick servers in or near most of the world's major cities, as well as working with internet service providers to set up dedicated connections to those servers. Riot has had problems optimizing connections and ping to their promised levels due to the increase in internet traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>

    <h4>Release</h4>
    <p>
        In October of 2019, Valorant was teased under the working title Project A. It was unveiled on March 1, 2020, with the release of "The Round," a gameplay video on YouTube. The closed beta of the game was launched on April 7, 2020.  For a chance to obtain a beta access key, 
        players were required to sign up for accounts with both Riot Games and the streaming platform Twitch and watch related streams. This beta ended on May 28, 2020, with the game being fully released on June 2, 2020.

    <h3>Anti-cheat software</h3>
    <p>
        The game has been criticized for its anti-cheat software, Vanguard, as it was revealed to run on a kernel driver, which allows access to the computer system.  OSNews expressed concern that Riot Games and its owner, Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent, could spy on players and that the kernel driver could be potentially exploited by third parties. 
        However, Riot Games stated that the driver does not send any information back to them, and launched a bug bounty program to offer rewards for reports that demonstrate vulnerabilities with the software. Valorant will not run on Windows 11 if the system does not have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 compliant cryptoprocessor enabled, as required by Microsoft's minimum system requirements for the operating system.
